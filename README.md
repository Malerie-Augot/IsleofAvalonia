Teacher Feedback: <br />
 4.8 / 5 - Awesome job - very well laid out.  Love the clouds animated on the main page. My only issue is the color of the main menu links is harder to read than they should. <br />

Assignment Instructions:

You are to design and create a web site on the topic of your choice.  The site is required to contain at least five (5) pages.  Your site will be graded for originality and design consistency, as well as efficient use of the following:

• Page Layout – make the layout easy to read and navigate. Keep the KISS rule in mind – Keep It Simple Stupid.  Make proper use of semantic tags and style each appropriately.

• CSS – Create  the  page  layout  using  CSS  and  the  Box  Model. Use of margins, borders and padding as required for attractive and effective design. Common styles and classes –especially text and links – are to be defined in CSS file and used for each page in your site.  

• Text formatting – fonts, sizes, colors, bold, italic, underline, etc.

• Use of colors - for backgrounds and text.

• Use of links – for navigation on the top of each page, at least two (2) links to related external sites, and Top of Page links for pages that exceed the browser screen.

• Use of images – at least five (5) related images, not including those on the main page.

• Use of lists – at least two lists, ordered or unordered.

• Use of tables–one (1) table for tabular data. You may create a banner for your site using any program you wish – but it must be saved as a .jpg file. The remainder of this site is to be completed using HTML/ CSS only.  Note that your site will be graded using Google Chrome.
